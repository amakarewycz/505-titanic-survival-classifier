      <h1>Titanic Survivability</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Improve existing model for predicting survivability on the titanic disaster</p>
    <h2>Baseline Model</h2>
    <p>A Logistic Regression Model</p>
    <p>The AUC is 77.3</p>

    <h2>Additional EDA</h2>
    <p>Looking at feature importance, it seems features like being a youthful female is a strong predictor at surviving the Titanic disaster.  Added a synthetic feature, &quot;young female&quot;, F(young female) = F(female)==true and (F(Age (20, 28]) == 1 or F(Age (28, 38]) == 1) and re-trained several models to see if it made any difference in the prediction outcomes.
</p>
    <p>Also looked at a coupld of variant for "young female".  Looked at "young male", "older male", "young female" in "Class 3".   All of these were no good, and worsened the model.</p>
      <h2>Model Selection</h2>
        <p>These are the results</p>
    <iframe src="imgs/possible_models.html" width="100%" height="500" style="border:1px solid black;">  </iframe>
    <p>Logistic Regression shows 2pt increase across all scores.</p>
    <p>Naive bayes is unchanged.</p>
    <p>Random forest is a little worse off than before, f1 score suffers the most reduction by 1.3 pts</p>
    <h2>Chosen Model</h2>

    <p>The AUC is improved by just over a point, to 78.5</p>

   <p>The confusion matrix shows improvement in TP and TN, and reduction in False Negatives, but not False Positives.</p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>Look at the false positives to see if there are any interesting patterns</p>

    <p>Look at using grid search to do the feature selection, see if we can come up with a better model with fewer features.  Expand the grid based on the defaults in play.</p>
